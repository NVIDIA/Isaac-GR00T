# Isaac GR00T N Model Post-training and Deployment
GR00T N models are the open foundation models for generalized humanoid reasoning and skills. These models take multi-modal input, including language and images, to perform manipulation tasks in diverse environments. These models are adaptable through post-training for specific embodiments, tasks and environments.
To address the challenge of data scarcity for training, synthetic data generation frameworks like Isaac GR00T-Mimic and GR00T-Dreams provide blueprints for creating rich training datasets that augment limited human-collected data. This approach enhances the post-training process, enabling GR00T N Models to achieve improved performance on downstream tasks.
This reference architecture outlines the comprehensive workflow for post-training GR00T N Models using NVIDIA RTX PRO Servers, followed by optimized deployment on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Thor Developer Kit.
