# 🚀 Isaac-GROOT Dockerized Setup

This repository provides a ready-to-run Docker environment for [NVIDIA's Isaac-GROOT](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T), a powerful robotics simulation and training framework built by NVIDIA. This container includes GPU support, Jupyter notebook access, and all required dependencies bundled with CUDA 12.4.

---

## 📦 What's Inside

- ✅ Ubuntu 22.04 Base (via `nvidia/cuda:12.4.1-cudnn-devel`)
- ✅ Python 3.10 with `pip`
- ✅ Jupyter Notebook pre-installed
- ✅ Full Isaac-GROOT repo cloned and installed in editable mode
- ✅ GPU support via NVIDIA Container Toolkit

---

## 🐳 Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/isaac-groot-docker.git
cd isaac-groot-docker
```

### 2. Build & Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This command:
- Builds the Docker image with tag `isaac-gr00t:v1`
- Launches a container using host networking
- Reserves all available NVIDIA GPUs

---

## 🚪 Accessing Jupyter Notebook

Once the container is running, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8888
```

You’ll see the Jupyter interface where you can begin experimenting with Isaac-GROOT.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

To run this setup, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose (v2+)
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit (for GPU passthrough)
- An NVIDIA GPU with drivers supporting CUDA 12.4

---

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
.
├── Dockerfile              # Custom image with Isaac-GROOT and dependencies
├── docker-compose.yaml     # Defines service and GPU access
└── README.md               # You're here!
```

---

## 🛠️ Useful Tips

- Want to modify the Isaac-GROOT code? Edit files directly in the `/GR00T` directory inside the container.
- To install more Python packages, you can use `pip install` inside the running container or modify the Dockerfile.
- You can change the default Jupyter port in the `CMD` section of the Dockerfile.
